    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu is a classic Italian dessert made by layering delicate flavors and creamy textures. It starts with a rich mascarpone cream, typically mixed with egg yolks and sugar until smooth and pale, then gently folded with whipped cream to keep it light and airy. Strong brewed coffee is prepared and cooled, giving the dessert its signature bittersweet depth without overpowering the cream.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee, cooled</li>
        <li>3 large eggs (separated)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>8 oz (225 g) mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>24 ladyfinger biscuits</li>
        <li>Unsweetened cocoa powder, for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brew the coffee and set it aside to cool completely.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and creamy. Add the mascarpone cheese and mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form, then gently fold it into the mascarpone mixture.</li>
        <li>In another clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form and carefully fold them into the cream mixture to keep it light.</li>
        <li>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the cooled coffee and arrange them in a single layer in a dish.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone cream over the ladyfingers. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining cream.</li>
        <li>Dust the top generously with cocoa powder, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours before serving.</li>
