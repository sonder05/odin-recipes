    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Adjaran khachapuri is a traditional Georgian bread known for its distinctive boat shape and rich, savory filling. The dough is baked until golden, then filled with a blend of melted cheeses that bubble and brown in the oven. Just before serving, a raw egg and a pat of butter are placed in the center, where the residual heat gently cooks the egg, creating a creamy, indulgent dish meant to be mixed and eaten hot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp instant yeast</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water or milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta</li>
        <li>2-3 eggs (one per khachapuri)</li>
        <li>Butter, for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix warm water (or milk), sugar, and yeast, and let it sit for a few minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and olive oil, then knead until a soft, elastic dough forms. Cover and let it rise for about 1 hour, until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C). Divide the dough into portions and roll each into an oval.</li>
        <li>Roll the edges inward on both sides and pinch the ends to form a boat shape.</li>
        <li>Mix the cheeses together and fill the center of each dough boat.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes, until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, add an egg to the center of each khachapuri, and return to the oven for 2–3 minutes until the egg white is just set.</li>
        <li>Top with a small piece of butter and serve hot, mixing the egg, butter, and cheese before eating.</li>
    </ol>
