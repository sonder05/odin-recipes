    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Kaymak is a rich, creamy dairy spread traditionally made by slowly heating milk and cream until a thick, silky layer forms on the surface. This layer is gently collected and rested so it develops a soft, slightly elastic texture and a mildly sweet, milky flavor. Kaymak is commonly enjoyed at breakfast or dessert, often served with bread, honey, or jam.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups whole milk (preferably not ultra-pasteurized)</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the milk and cream into a wide, shallow pot or pan and gently heat over low heat without stirring.</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to slowly heat until it just begins to steam and a thick skin forms on the surface; do not let it boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to very low and let it simmer gently for about 1–2 hours, allowing the surface layer to thicken.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from heat and let it cool completely at room temperature, then refrigerate for several hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Carefully lift the thickened cream layer from the top and transfer it to a container.</li>
        <li>The kaymak is ready to serve or can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days.</li>
    </ol>
